Ev3
===

Ev3 is a C++ library to compute symbolic derivatives written by [Leo Liberti] (http://www.lix.polytechnique.fr/~liberti/academic.html).

It is an alternative to [libmatheval](http://www.gnu.org/software/libmatheval/) but under the more permissive [CPL](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_Public_License) license.

The library was originaly available [here](http://www.lix.polytechnique.fr/~liberti/Ev3-1.0.tar.gz), and used also [here] (https://projects.coin-or.org/ROSE/browser/rose/Ev3) with some modifications. This is the debugged version used in the [OpenTURNS](www.openturns.org) software.
